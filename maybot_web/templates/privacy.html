        <h1>Maybot/Political Theresa - Privacy & Legal</h1>
        <p>Maybot (also known as Political Theresa on some platforms) is a recurrent neural network
            that completes sentences in the style of Theresa May's parliamentary spoken contributions
            scraped from Hansard.
        </p>
        <p>When you view this website or enter some initial words for the network to complete
            either on the website or using one of the voice-based platforms that Maybot is available
            on, we log this activity, recording date/time, IP address, initial words entered
            and the completed sentence generated by the network.
        </p>
        <p>We use this information for debugging and program improvement. We may also publish
            some of the initial words and completed sentences generated by the network where they
            are notable or funny. Any information we publish will be anonymous. We will not share
            information with third parties and will only disclose identifying information if
            forced to do so by a court order from an English court.
        </p>
        <p>The sentences generated by Maybot are completely as a result of its training. We
            have not engineered any specific outputs. We don't think it is likely, but the
            network could produce inappropriate or offensive content. By using this site, you
            accept this and will not hold Argon Design Ltd liable for any results generated.
